          <p>Off the Grid began in June of 2010 with the simple idea that grouping Street Food vendors together similar to an “asian night market” would create an experience that would allow neighbors to connect with friends, and families to reconnect with each other. Since then Off the Grid has worked hard to develop markets that are both located in urban cores of cities, and that utilize spaces that are not easily activated effectively throughout the day. In 2010 Off the Grid opened 3 markets. In 2011 Off the Grid opened 9 more. Off the Grid is proud of its role organizing, promoting and managing all of its markets, and the small mobile food businesses that we work with. Off the Grid relies heavily on the power of social media to connect with its audience (for its first 6 months OtG only had a Facebook page). Currently Off the Grid operates 23 weekly markets in the greater bay area, and works with over 150 vendors weekly. Off the Grid believes in promoting win-win opportunities for the small local businesses that we work with, maintaining a fixed cost structure that is well below other standard events rates. At its core, Off the Grid believes in the power of a shared food experience to connect communities, and we work hard to maintain a shared sense of space wherever we serve.</p>
